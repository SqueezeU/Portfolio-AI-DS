## ðŸ§© Project 2 â€“ ETL & EDA with KNIME

This workflow was developed as part of **Project 2** during my AI and Data Science training at **IMPÃˆLIA**.  
The **KNIME** tool was used to perform data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis (ETL & EDA)  
on a real estate dataset from Barcelona (Fotocasa).

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Prepare a clean, structured dataset ready for further machine learning and visualization processes (Power BI).

### ðŸŒ¸ Workflow Features

- Removal of duplicates, inconsistent values, and nulls  
- Logical imputation of missing values using median or the "Unknown" category  
- Type conversions and numeric rounding  
- Neighborhood-based grouping to infer unknown values  
- Detection and treatment of outliers using conditional filters  
- Replacement of erroneous values using rules (Rule Engine)
