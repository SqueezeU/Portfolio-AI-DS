## 🟨 Audio Transcription and FAQ Generation with Whisper

This project is part of a workflow designed to convert real voice calls into a structured database of frequently asked questions (FAQs).  
It uses the **Whisper** model from OpenAI to perform transcriptions **automatically and offline** (local installation).
