## ü§ñ Machine Learning Prediction ‚Äì Project 1 & 2

This section contains two practical projects focused on prediction models using Python and AutoML tools.

---

### üß† Project 1 ‚Äì Modeling with Python

This project was part of my first practical exercise during my training in AI and Data Science (IMP√àLIA).

üìå **Includes:**

- Data loading and exploratory analysis (EDA)  
- Data cleaning and transformation  
- Basic feature engineering  
- Data preparation for prediction  
- Application of a Machine Learning (ML) model

üìò **Original notebook:**  
[`An√°lisis exploratorio y modelado predictivo de precios de viviendas en Barcelona.ipynb`](https://github.com/SqueezeU/Portfolio-AI-DS/blob/main/ETL-EDA%20Python/An%C3%A1lisis%20exploratorio%20y%20modelado%20predictivo%20de%20precios%20de%20viviendas%20en%20Barcelona.ipynb)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**  
The original dataset (CSV) is not included due to privacy reasons.  
The notebook is provided **as a structured reference** to illustrate the full logic applied in the project ‚Äì it is **not directly executable** without the data.

### üß™ Project 2 ‚Äì Prediction with WatsonX (collaboration)

This project was developed in a team during my training in AI and Data Science (IMP√àLIA).  
The objective was to build a prediction model for rental housing prices in Barcelona using **IBM WatsonX**.

üîπ **My contribution:**

- Data cleaning and transformation (ETL)  
- Visualization of key variables using Power BI  
- Coordination of data flow toward the model

üî∏ **Contribution of my teammate Javier de Andr√©s Mart√≠nez:**

- Model development using IBM WatsonX (AutoAI)  
- Evaluation and optimization of the model (`XGBRegressor`)

üìÑ **Final report:**  
[`Rental Housing Data ‚Äì WatsonX Model (PDF)`](https://github.com/SqueezeU/Portfolio-AI-DS/blob/main/ML%20Prediction/Datos%20de%20viviendas%20en%20alquiler%20en%20la%20ciudad%20de%20Barcelona%20-%20P4%20Regresor%20XGB%20-%20Modelo_2025_1_8_17_23_27.pdf)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**  
This repository does not include the model code, which was generated on the IBM platform.  
The focus here is to document the collaborative workflow and the results obtained.
